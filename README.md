# Cystal Unclear
This project seeks to explore the capacity of piezoelectricity present in some crystals to create algorithmic compositions. In this round, I especifically focused on tourmaline as instrument interface. Through experimentation with raw materials, it seeks to create musical pieces that somehow confront the "natural" (crystals) with the machinistic (algorithmic/software).
