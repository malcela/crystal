# Algorithmic crystals 
This project seeks to explore the capacity of piezoelectricity present in sugar and salt crystals to create algorithmic compositions. Through experimentation with basic materials, it seeks to create musical pieces that somehow confront the "natural" (crystals) with the machinistic (algorithmic).
