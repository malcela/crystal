# Cystal Unclear
This project seeks to explore the capacity of piezoelectricity present in some crystals to create algorithmic compositions, this round is especifically focus on tourmaline. Through experimentation with basic materials, it seeks to create musical pieces that somehow confront the "natural" (crystals) with the machinistic (algorithmic/software).
